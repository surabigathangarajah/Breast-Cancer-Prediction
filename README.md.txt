Project Scenario

You are building a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has breast cancer based on medical measurements of their cell nuclei.

Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

Features (inputs): Measurements like radius, texture, smoothness, area, etc. of the cells

Target (output):

0 = Malignant (cancerous)

1 = Benign (non-cancerous)

Your goal: Use these features to train a binary classification model that predicts if a tumor is malignant or benign.

Step 1: Load and explore the dataset

Load the dataset (built into scikit-learn)

Convert it into a DataFrame

Check first 5 rows to understand the data

Check for missing values

Why: You need to know what features you have and make sure there‚Äôs no missing or invalid data before training a model.

Step 2: Prepare features and target

Features (X): All the numeric measurements

Target (y): Malignant / Benign (0 or 1)

Why: ML models need X for input and y for output.

Step 3: Split into training and test sets

Use 80% of data for training, 20% for testing

This ensures your model is evaluated on unseen data

Why: Helps you check if the model generalizes well and isn‚Äôt just memorizing the data.

Step 4: Train the classification model

Start with Logistic Regression (simple and effective)

Optionally try Random Forest for comparison

Why: To see how well different models can predict cancer type.

Step 5: Evaluate the model

Use metrics like:

Accuracy ‚Üí % of correct predictions

Confusion matrix ‚Üí True/False Positives/Negatives

Classification report ‚Üí Precision, Recall, F1-score

Why: This shows how well your model performs and where it may make mistakes.

Step 6: Optional Enhancements

Feature importance visualization (which measurements matter most)

Comparing multiple models (Logistic Regression vs Random Forest vs SVM)

Saving the model for future predictions

Classification Report
Class	      Precision	Recall	F1-Score Support
0 (Benign)	0.97	0.91	0.94	   43
1 (Malignant)	0.95	0.99	0.97	   71
Overall	        0.96	0.96	0.96	   114

Confusion Matrix
[[39  4]
 [ 1 70]]


39 benign correctly predicted, 4 misclassified.

70 malignant correctly predicted, only 1 misclassified.

üèÜ Key Takeaways

Logistic Regression gave high accuracy (95.6%).

The model performed very well in identifying malignant cases (only 1 false negative).

Simple to train, interpret, and deploy for real-world applications.
